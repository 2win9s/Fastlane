# Work in progress

currently results are pretty bad will upload if they improve

training on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis dataset
entity labels removed. Am only using the data from training.csv split into 3.
The content of the csv file have been extracted and split into the text.txt and label.txt so I can easily use them with fstream



UPDATE: many more bugs in code, trying to optimise C++ code is a nightmare, I've got more bugs than a wasp nest. I should also use a profiler but trying to minimise unecessary memory allocations as a rule of thumb seems to speed things up quite nicely

Maybe I should learn hwo to do tokenisation?
