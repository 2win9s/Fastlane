# Work in progress

currently results are pretty bad will upload if they improve

training on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis dataset
entity labels removed



progress is slow, loss goin down slowly but if learning rate is increased loss explodes, contemplating other optimisation algorithms maybe ADAM?
