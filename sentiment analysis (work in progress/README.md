# Work in progress

currently results are pretty bad will upload if they improve

training on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis dataset
entity labels removed. Am only using the data from training.csv split into 3.
The content of the csv file have been extracted and split into the text.txt and label.txt so I can easily use them with fstream



UPDATE: As a half baked amateur programmer, I had made a severe mistake in only giving every tenth character as input for the neural network, that is obviously not enough information for any degree of accuracy, I'm back to square one.
