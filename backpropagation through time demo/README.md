# Backpropagation through time

After all fastlane is supposed to be a RNN so here we demonstrate the most basic capability of an RNN, remembering information through timesteps, here we do the simple test of addition. Every timestep the output is supposed to be the sum of previous inputs (simple addition).

Not very impressive but demonstrates that the implementation for bptt does indeed work.
