# Artifical Stupidity

This my C++ implementation of "fastlane" and the associated functions encapsulated in a struct, it is quite bare bones and the serialization/ deserialization to text is in a terrible format. If for whatever reason you stumble accross it and want to play with it, I suggest reading the implementation and adding what you want. It is quite short and has been constantly changing so I'm not writing documentation just yet, hopefully the comments are suffcient.


None of the code is parallelised because it is pointless for me at least, I don't excatly have the processing power to do so If I wish to use my laptop for anything else in the meantime. Also myriad of possible bugs waiting to happen too
