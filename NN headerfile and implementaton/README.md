# Artifical Stupidity

This my C++ implementation of "fastlane" and the associated functions encapsulated in a struct, it is quite bare bones and the serialization/ deserialization to text is in a terrible format. If for whatever reason you stumble accross it and want to play with it, I suggest reading the implementation and adding what you want. It is quite short and has been constantly changing so I'm not writing documentation just yet, hopefully the comments are suffcient.
