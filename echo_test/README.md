# ECHO (work in progress)

Can the architecture be trained easily? and can it retain information over many timesteps?
here are my attempts:
memory_leak.txt, the model serialized in this text file can be fed an input and recall it many timesteps later but nothing beyond that and with a few caveats

So far a few technival issues for more complex neural nets


note: when compiling the code remember to compile with NN.cpp in from the other folder (and the header file too obviously)
